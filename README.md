This folder includes Supplementary Data for the review manuscript of the chewing louse genus _Myrsidea_ (Phthiraptera:Amblycera:Menoponidae).
Version 1.00

**Supplementary Dataset 1:** The checklist of all (1) valid Myrsidea species updated with their host associations, authorship, references, and occurrences; (2) Myrsidea sp. updated with their host associations, occurrences, and publication with host association data; and (3) Myrsidea for which the status or host associations are questionable. NA – North America, MA – Middle America, SA – South America, AF – Africa, EU – Eurasia, IM – Indomalaya, AU -Australia, IO – Indian Ocean.

**Supplementary Dataset S2.**  Fasta alignment of 320 Myrsidea sequences of a 379 bp fragment of cytochrome oxidase subunit I and the raw tree data file.

**Supplementary Table S1.** List of Myrsidea and outgroup (Apomyrsidea and Menacanthus) specimens used for the phylogenetic analyses, with their GenBank Accession Numbers, host information, and their country of collection. Map of the representation of sequence data (a 379 bp fragment of cytochrome oxidase subunit I) for each country is included in the file for the visual presentation.
